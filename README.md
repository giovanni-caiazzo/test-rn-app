This is a test React Native App written in TypeScript

### How do I get set up? ###

* Run `yarn` to get your dependencies
* Run `yarn prebuild` to have expo generate the `android` and `ios` folders
* Attach your phone to your computer with an usb cable and enter android debugging mode (or start an emulator)
* The first time you will need to run `yarn android`, then you can always run `yarn start`.
* Run `yarn start` in this directory and press `a` when prompted to launch the app on your phone (or `i` if you have an iphone)
* You can log in using username `test@gmail.com` and password `test`
